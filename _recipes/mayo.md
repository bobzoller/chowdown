title:  "Mayonnaise"
image: mayo.jpg

ingredients:
- 1 large egg
- 3-4 teaspoons white vinegar, apple cider vinegar, or lemon juice, to taste
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white or black pepper
- 1 cup avocado, olive, or other neutral vegetable oil

directions:
- In a blender or food processor, blend together the egg, lemon juice, mustard, fine sea salt, and freshly ground white or black pepper, blending until well combined.
- With the motor still running, add the oil in a very slow, thin, steady stream and blend until the dressing is thick and smooth.
- Transfer to an airtight container and leave at room temperature for 2-4 hours. This allows the acid to kill any bacteria in the egg.
- Move to the refrigerator, where it can be kept for 1-2 weeks.
